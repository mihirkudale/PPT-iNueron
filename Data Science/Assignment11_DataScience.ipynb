    "1. How do word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Word embeddings are a type of text representation that captures the semantic meaning of words. They do this by representing each word as a vector of real numbers. The values in the vector are typically learned from a large corpus of text, and they reflect the statistical relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the word \"cat\" might be represented by a vector that has high values for the dimensions that correspond to the concepts of \"animal\", \"furry\", and \"domesticated\". The word \"dog\" might be represented by a vector that has similar values, but with slightly different weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows word embeddings to capture the semantic similarity between words. For example, the word embeddings for \"cat\" and \"dog\" will be more similar to each other than the word embeddings for \"cat\" and \"table\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This semantic similarity can be used to improve the performance of many NLP tasks, such as text classification, machine translation, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the ways that word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Word co-occurrence:** Word embeddings are often trained on a large corpus of text. The frequency with which words co-occur in the corpus is used to learn the semantic relationships between words. For example, the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" are likely to co-occur more often than the words \"cat\" and \"table\". This is because cats and dogs are often mentioned together in the same contexts.\n",
    "* **Word analogy:** Word embeddings can also be used to solve word analogy problems. For example, the analogy \"king is to man as queen is to ?\" can be solved by finding the word that is most similar to the word \"queen\" in the context of the analogy. The word \"woman\" is the most likely answer, because it has a similar semantic meaning to \"queen\".\n",
    "* **Semantic similarity:** Word embeddings can be used to measure the semantic similarity between words. This can be done by calculating the cosine similarity between the word embeddings. The cosine similarity between two vectors is a measure of how similar the vectors are in direction. For example, the cosine similarity between the word embeddings for \"cat\" and \"dog\" will be higher than the cosine similarity between the word embeddings for \"cat\" and \"table\".\n",

    "Word embeddings are a powerful tool for capturing semantic meaning in text preprocessing. They can be used to improve the performance of many NLP tasks, and they are becoming increasingly popular in the field of natural language processing."
